# üèéÔ∏è Formula 1 Lap Time Prediction  
### *Optimization Project - 2025*


## üìÅ Dataset  
üîó [**Kaggle Notebook: Data Exploration with OCI**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jasperan/01-data-exploration-with-oci)  

> This project does **not** use a pre-existing dataset on Kaggle. Instead, the dataset was **created independently** by leveraging the code and methodology from the linked Kaggle notebook.  
> The notebook demonstrates how to collect detailed lap-by-lap data of Formula 1 Grand Prix races using a **FastAPI** service ([FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)) to query and aggregate telemetry and race conditions.

The final dataset contains rich information about laps, cars, tires, fuel, track and environmental conditions of the 2023 and 2024 seasons, all essential to build predictive models.


## üöÄ Project Goals  
- Develop linear regression models to predict lap times based on multiple variables  
- Implement optimization techniques derived from gradient descent methods to minimize prediction error  
- Analyze model performance and interpret the influence of different factors on lap times  


## üêç Code Structure  
The code is written in Python and developed using Jupyter Notebook.
